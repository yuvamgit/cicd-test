# Step 1: Use a Node.js image to build the frontend
FROM node:18-alpine AS build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Use an Nginx image to serve the built files
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the built files from the previous stage
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the default Nginx port
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
